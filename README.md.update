# EDA App - Improvements

The following improvements have been made to the application:

## Functionality Fixes

1. Fixed correlation matrix display issues:
   - Resolved field naming inconsistency between backend and frontend (`column1/column2` vs `feature1/feature2`)
   - Applied correlation matrix rendering patch for proper visualization
   - Improved data passing between backend workers and frontend display

2. Enhanced chart generation capabilities:
   - Fixed visualization of correlation data
   - Improved chart type selection based on data characteristics

3. Fixed data integrity analysis:
   - Ensured proper integration of Australian-specific checks
   - Improved error handling for edge cases

## Security Enhancements

1. Updated Electron configuration in `main.js` for better security:
   - Enabled `contextIsolation` (true)
   - Disabled `nodeIntegration` (false) 
   - Improved the preload script to safely expose only necessary APIs to the renderer process

2. Enhanced Content Security Policy (CSP):
   - Removed unsafe-inline directives
   - Applied more restrictive CSP headers
   - Properly configured permissions

3. Fixed inline scripts:
   - Moved inline JavaScript to separate files:
     - Created `theme.js` for dark mode functionality
     - Created `llm-export.js` for LLM export functionality
   - Moved inline styles to `style.css`

## Code Structure Improvements

1. Improved modularity:
   - Extracted inline code to separate modules
   - Better separation of concerns

2. Dependency Optimization:
   - Moved `puppeteer` and `d3.js` to devDependencies
   - `puppeteer` is only used in test-script.js for testing
   - D3.js appears to be unused in the codebase
   
3. Testing and Validation:
   - Created `test-correlation.js` for verifying correlation matrix functionality
   - Enhanced `test-script.js` for automated UI testing
   - Added detailed logging for data analysis steps

## How to Use

Run the application with:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the Electron app
npm start

# Start Express server only
npm run server

# Start development server with auto-reload
npm run dev
```

## Testing

Verify correlation matrix functionality:

```bash
node test-correlation.js
```

Run automated UI tests:

```bash
node test-script.js
```
